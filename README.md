Discription:

The purpose of this project is to detect and count the number of bottles present in an image of a bottle crate.
The algorithm utilizes image processing techniques to isolate and identify circular objects representing bottles

It effectively detects and counts the number of bottles present in the input image of a bottle crate.
By employing a combination of image preprocessing, circle detection using Hough transform, and post-processing
techniques, it achieves accurate and reliable bottle counting results. Additionally, the algorithm is flexible and
can be adapted to different bottle crate images with minor adjustments to parameters and thresholds
